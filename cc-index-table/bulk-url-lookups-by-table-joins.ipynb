    "# Table Joins to Look Up Large Lists of URLs in the Common Crawl\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Short Introduction to URL indexes and SURT URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "### The CDX Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The Common Crawl CDX index [index.commoncrawl.org](https://index.commoncrawl.org/) allows to look up quickly whether a web page is contained in one of the monthly main crawls. Just a single request\n",
    "```\n",
    "curl -s 'https://index.commoncrawl.org/CC-MAIN-2021-10-index?url=https://commoncrawl.org/2021/02/january-2021-crawl-archive-now-available/&output=cdxj'\n",
    "```\n",
    "is sufficient to figure out that the announcement of the January crawl is included in the archives of the February crawl:\n",
    "```\n",
    "org,commoncrawl)/2021/02/january-2021-crawl-archive-now-available 20210303023607 {\"url\": \"https://commoncrawl.org/2021/02/january-2021-crawl-archive-now-available/\", \"mime\": \"text/html\", \"mime-detected\": \"text/html\", \"status\": \"200\", \"digest\": \"6JKL2JMU4HFJMZAH65BZZET653JJP53I\", \"length\": \"6922\", \"offset\": \"250975924\", \"filename\": \"crawl-data/CC-MAIN-2021-10/segments/1614178365186.46/warc/CC-MAIN-20210303012222-20210303042222-00595.warc.gz\", \"languages\": \"eng\", \"encoding\": \"UTF-8\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Every line in the index contains\n",
    "* the URL search key aka. SURT (\"Sort-friendly URI Reordering Transform\")\n",
    "* the capture time stamp\n",
    "* a JSON object containing the URL, metadata and the location of a capture in the crawl archives\n",
    "\n",
    "The so-called [zipnum sharded index](https://pywb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual/indexing.html?highlight=zipnum#zipnum-sharded-index) is sorted by the SURT URL key and split over 300 files. The index lines are gzip-compressed in blocks of 3000 lines. A secondary block index makes it possible to determine the block which should include a certain URL performing a quick binary search. Then the block is uncompressed to verify whether the URL is included, and if yes to extract the matched record(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the host name in the SURT URL is reversed (`subdomain.example.org` becomes `org,example,subdomain`), queries for all subdomains of a domain are possible by doing a prefix search. Other normalizations make the SURT URL even more powerful for prefix look-ups: eg. sorting of URL query parameters, removal of the protocol (`https://`) or stripping off the leading `www.` in host names. These variations in the URL often lead to redirects or duplicated content. However, they are not safe to be normalized in a hard way because in few cases web servers may serve different page content for different URLs sharing the same SURT representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Columnar Index\n",
    "\n",
    "The [columnar index](https://commoncrawl.org/2018/03/index-to-warc-files-and-urls-in-columnar-format/) has the following differences compared to the CDX index:\n",
    "- look-ups are not limited to the SURT URL, but are possible ony any provided column including content type (MIME), content languages and all URL parts (host name, registered domain, path, query)\n",
    "- the columnar structure is efficient and saves costs if only a subset of the columns is accessed\n",
    "- big data tools support SQL queries and aggregations ([Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/)/[Presto](https://prestodb.io/), [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/), [Hive](https://hive.apache.org/))\n",
    "- however, usage of a tool able to query the [Parquet file format](https://parquet.apache.org/) is required\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Index Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "For practical reasons - because 3 billion pages contribute to an index size of about 300 GiB, every monthly crawl is indexed separately. So, you would typically use a CDX client (eg. [cdx-toolkit](https://pypi.org/project/cdx-toolkit/)) which takes the work to iterate over a list of indexes for a given time window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also the [columnar index](https://commoncrawl.org/2018/03/index-to-warc-files-and-urls-in-columnar-format/) stores every monthly crawl in a separate partition to alleviate the addition of a new crawl and also to target queries to individual crawls at zero computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficiently Looking Up Large Lists of URLs\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to our problem: how to look up a large list of URLs in the Common Crawl index...\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless the URLs share a common prefix, for example a domain name, the CDX index isn't the best data structure to do this. The task translates into a series of look ups and does not scale well - the number of queries is equal to the number of URLs multiplied by the number of requested monthly indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, runnning multiple queries over the columnar index isn't efficient. Instead we\n",
    "\n",
    "1. create a support table which holds the list of URLs we want to look up\n",
    "2. [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/) will do a table join to perform the intersection\n",
    "3. the result table holds an export of the record coordinates but can be also utilized to further analyze or filter the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the SURT URLs to get a better recall without the need to artificially generate potential variants.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variants and Further Optimizations\n",
    "\n",
    "- if possible try to further restrict the selection to perform the join on:\n",
    "  - few monthly crawls\n",
    "  - select on a crawl subset (successful fetches, robots.txt, 404s/redirects)\n",
    "  - only URLs in certain top-level domains\n",
    "\n",
    "  Simply add the restrictions to the WHERE-clause of the join query.\n",
    "\n",
    "- if the URL list isn't really random but does belong to a set of host or domain names: performing the join on the columns `url_host_name` or `url_host_registered_domain` might be more efficient. Cf. [count-domains-alexa-top-1m.sql](https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-index-table/blob/master/src/sql/examples/cc-index/count-domains-alexa-top-1m.sql) for a join on the domain name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- if the list of URLs or domains is rather short, using the [Presto array functions](https://prestodb.io/docs/current/functions/array.html#array-functions) is much simpler than a table join:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM ccindex\n",
    "WHERE contains(ARRAY ['example.com', '...'], url_host_registered_domain);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing the URL List\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to prepare the URL list:\n",
    "1. add the SURT URL as a column\n",
    "2. convert it into a tabular format (Parquet)\n",
    "3. upload the data to S3 and\n",
    "4. import it as table into Athena\n",
