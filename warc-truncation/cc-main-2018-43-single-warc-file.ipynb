    "# Truncated Records in WARC Files (October 2018)\n",
    "\n",
    "Content payload in Common Crawl archives is truncated if the content exceeds a limit of\n",
    "- [500 kiB in 2008 – 2012 ARC files](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/common-crawl/hQTRnWahcHA/discussion)\n",
    "- 1 MiB in WARC files (since 2013)\n",
    "\n",
    "The truncation is required to keep the crawl archives at a limited size and ensure that a broad sample of web pages is covered. It also avoids that the archives are filled by accidentally captured video or audio streams. The crawler needs to buffer the content temporarily and a limit ensures that this is possible with a limited amount of RAM for many parallel connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While the mission of Common Crawl has always been to provide a broad sample of HTML pages, there have been always users interested in the various other document formats: PDF, office documents, etc.  Recently, a discussion started in the [Common Crawl forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/common-crawl) to [increase the 1 MiB content limit](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/common-crawl/JJW6fv1rUQw/discussion). It also turned out that there are issues regarding the marking of truncated payloads using the [WARC-Truncated header](https://iipc.github.io/warc-specifications/specifications/warc-format/warc-1.1/#warc-truncated), see [cc/nutch#10](//github.com/commoncrawl/nutch/issues/10).\n",

Truncated records are extracted using cc-pyspark, see [cc-pyspark#9](//github.com/commoncrawl/cc-pyspark/pull/9).\n",
    "\n",
    "The length limit is applied to the binary content after it the HTTP protocol-level content and transfer encoding have been removed (decoded). Every WARC record consists of WARC headers, HTTP headers and content payload and is as a whole compressed using gzip. This leads to a couple of length metrics (bytes):\n",
    "- `warc_record_length`: WARC compressed record length (WARC headers, HTTP headers and content payload)\n",
    "- `warc_content_length`: uncompressed length of HTTP headers and content payload (obligatorily given by `Content-Lenght` WARC header)\n",
    "- `http_content_length` resp. `payload_length`: the actual size of the payload\n",
    "- `http_orig_content_length`: the original value of the HTTP `Content-Length` header (if present) which indicates the entire length with protocol-level compression applied\n",
